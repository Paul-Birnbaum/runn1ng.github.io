You need to clone the eman repo and, additionaly, the default experiments from here

    git clone https://redmine.ms.mff.cuni.cz/eman.git
    git clone https://redmine.ms.mff.cuni.cz/ufal-smt-playground.git


...and that's it. The first thing is eman itself, the second thing is an example playground (more on that later) plus some mess that can be probably cleaned up but nobody knows exactly.
