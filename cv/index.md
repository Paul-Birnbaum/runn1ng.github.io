### Insolve, Irekon
Turnov — 2010 - now

I am writing and maintaining a system for insolvency administrators for easier access to their cases. I am the sole writer and maintainer of the system.

In 2014, I rewrote the system from Client-Server Java GUI application to a browser application, based on Nette/PHP with some bits of JavaScript..


The system helped Irekon become one of the 3 biggest insolvency administrators in Czech Republic, [serving more than 1.000 cases](http://insolvence.statnisprava.cz/Insolvence_stat_spravci.aspx).



### Vice-chairman, head of IT, head of propagation, Spolek Matfyzák (student club of MFF students)

While being at the student club of MFF, I was helping organizing student events. I was fully responsible for website, graphics and propagation on both website and social networks. I was also responsible for several LAMP systems.


### FilmTit, Software Project, MFF

In a 6-person group, we wrote and deployed system for translation of movie subtitles, mainly from English to Czech. The core of the system was one half Moses, one half traditional translation memory.


### Pirate Bay archive

As an experiment, I tried to extract the whole archive of Pirate Bay torrents in magnet format.
